# Unsinkkey
A quick internet search gives results for various keychains and bottle openers, both floating and phosphorescent, but it is hard to find a product that would combine all four attributes: keychain, bottle opener, floating, phosphorescent. The team was not able to find such a product after a quick  internet search performed in February 2023. 

## Abstract
The purpose of this project was to find out whether floating key chains could be improved. The team started by utilizing well known methods for ideation of new types of products. After deciding on a specific product, which is a floating key holder that has the ability to open bottles as well as glow in the dark, the team utilized a number of proven methods for reducing risks and streamlining the business model, manufacturing and distribution. Surveys were conducted and used together with decision making tools in order to get inputs from potential customers. Because of the relative simplicity of the product, prototyping was given a large role in the product development process, and several iterations of the product was made. The whole aforementioned process is described in detail in this report.

## Introduction

Figure above shows a 3D rendering of the final version of Unsinkkey. The "claw-shaped" end of the product is the bottle opener, while the other end is the key holder. In the middle, where the text "Unsinkkey" and "Designed in Norway" are visible, the customer can choose to have their own name, company logo etc. engraved. The product is hollow to ensure floating of the keys attached to it. It also glows in the dark to be easy to find, and is made by 3D printing from recyclable ABS plastic.

### Background

Dropping your boat keys in the water is never a clever idea, but it might happen. To address this issue, there are several floating keychains on the market. However, the team wanted to see if they could develop this product further. 

### Scope

The team came up with two new features that, according to their knowledge, are not present in any other products that are easily available on the market:
- The keychain would double as a bottle opener, this way eliminating the need for a separate bottle opener aboard a boat.
- item The keychain would include phosphorescent materials, which would make it easy to find even if dropped into the water in darkness.

A quick internet search (February 2023) gives results for various keychains and bottle openers, both floating and phosphorescent, but it is hard to find a product that would combine all four attributes: keychain, bottle opener, floating, phosphorescent.

## Method

### Detailed Scoping

By combining a keychain and a bottle opener, and by making it both float and glow in the dark, we can provide the end user with a single product that fulfills needs that they might otherwise need 3 products for (floating keychain, with a reflector attached to it, and a separate bottle opener). This means that the product in itself already promotes dematerialization of the economy, which is one well known to be of the key elements of circularity and thereby sustainability.

By optimizing the materials used, together with manufacturing, packaging, and distribution, it is possible to further optimize for sustainability, in order to stay competitive into the future. The product has an innovative business model, including elements of circularity. There is a monetary deposit system acting as an incentive to return the product to us at the end of its life system as well as a system that donates a fixed sum of money for each sold item to project(s) promoting sustainability.

### Experiments for the Best Match of Attributes Using Taguchi-Method

There are three variables for the product, where should be found the best match, from:
- Material (ABS, PLA, PETG)
- Type of bottle opener (hook, ring)
- Number of layers while printing (2, 4, 6)

The full factorial matrix was created for this experiment:

<img width="769" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2e1f74-1a7d-4f8b-a61e-9fee589b8944" />

According to the table above a full factorial requires 18 experiments, which is a lot, regarding manufacturing costs and time. Therefore, the team decided to do a fractional experiment}. After the decision of doing less experiments, checking the prediction lead to the decision to do a fractional experiment.

<img width="367" height="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1172f30c-63cc-46fb-bbe1-847380fa4595" />

The variables are changed to minimum, zero and maximum: (-1, 0 and 1), for making fractial design experiment, where will be chosen only:

<img width="418" height="34" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a33a1b45-4618-4e03-a9b0-d93aa34c84b8" />

<img width="457" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c553a2-a5fa-45ec-bad8-890a1111d131" />

Implementing fractional design of experiment comparing to the number of experiments was possible to decrease from 18 to 10. The next steps are: 
- Run experiments
- Get the result of each experiments
- Predict the best match

<img width="722" height="168" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed0be25-6ebf-4494-93cd-8e2cdd5fb41f" />

According to the formula above, the prediction shows the best result for the product with: 
- Material: ABS
- Design of opener: Hook
- Number of layers: 6

Using 6 layers of material is too much, regarding material usage during mass production. So, to make a prediction, the same inputs are used, but reduced the number of layers to 4, which is the experimentally determined optimal value.

### Functions and Requirements

In total the product has a few features.
- Floating
- Glowing in the dark
- Holding the keys (Technically required to hold only the boat's keys, as it is made mainly for use on boats, but it was thought by the team to be better to increase the size to 2-3 times this value, to make it more comfortable and pocket friendly, allowing the costumer to use the product in ordinary life.)
- Being able to open bottles with a crown cork.

Looking at this, it can be summed up, that the main interest of the product is keys. The feature of 'floating' requires bigger volume allowing the buoyancy to overcome the weight of the product itself. The solution for the product is having empty space inside, while being totally closed from outside: to prevent water from leaking inside.

## Result

### Product Idea and Novelty

A quick internet search gives results for various keychains and bottle openers, both floating and phosphorescent, but it is hard to find a product that would combine all four attributes: keychain, bottle opener, floating, phosphorescent. The team was not able to find such a product after a quick  internet search performed in February 2023. 

### Product description

The floating key holder combined with a bottle opener is a product that offers both safety and comfort. The product fits nicely in the customers hands, and has a u-shaped key holder in one end, and a bottle cap gripping shape in the other end.

The safety aspect comes from that it in extreme events can save the people on a boat from getting stranded on an island or out at sea, due to losing their keys to the water. Including phosphorescent materials makes the product glow in the dark, without any kind of battery, lights or electronics needed.  

The bottle opening function might come in handy from a comfort point of view. This eliminates the need for a separate bottle opener, which in addition to saving the customer money and space, also contributes to the dematerialization of the economy, and thereby acts as an environmentally friendly option. 

The product development team contacted an industrial design student, who helped steer the design in terms of user friendliness and aesthetics. Following the discussions with the industrial designer, the first paper sketch was input to CAD software, and prototypes were 3D printed from PLA (Polylactic Acid). The team chose PLA for prototyping due to it being easily available, environmentally friendly, and affordable, although ABS plastic proved to be the overall best material in the end.

## Discussion

### Potential Future Products

The team has brainstormed the next generation of products that could be produced after Unsinkkey if the product sells well and the budget of the company allows. One idea could be to make a version that has a sensor that registers every time a bottle is opened. This could then be linked to an app on the users smartphone. In the app, the user could register what drinks he will open or has opened, and this could then provide the user with tips based on the data collected. If for example the user registers as opening (and assumably drinking) only sodas, the app could show the user how many calories have been obtained. In case the user claims to drink only beer with a certain amount of alcohol, the app could suggest the user to not drive the boat (or any vehicle for that matter) after opening a certain number of bottles within a certain time frame.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it can be said that Unsinkkey provided a good challenge for the team. The product and the idea for it's entire life cycle were created and optimized trough utilizing well known and proven methods of ideation, innovation, prototyping, decision making, risk reducing and streamlining of production, marketing, distribution and the business model in general.

The final decision was to forward with a product called the "Unsinkkey", which is a floating key chain to prevent boat owners' keys from sinking if dropped in the water, which doubles as a bottle opener, and glows in the dark for easy spotting even in the dark.
